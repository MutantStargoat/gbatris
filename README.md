About
-----
gbatris is a tetris game for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance.

I always liked the original GameBoy tetris, and not any of the "improved"
versions that where released for the GBA and the Nintendo DS. So I made gbatris
to be as close as possible to the original GameBoy tetris gameplay-wise.

gbatris is based on my previous `termtris` project, which runs in
ANSI/VT220-compatible terminals on UNIX systems:
